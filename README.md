# COVID-Exploratory-Data-Analsis-and-Research

1.	How the percent of the total population with confirmed covid-19 has changed in different countries from February through October. In which countries, the disease has spread the fastest and the slowest. How has the disease spread on different continents? What are the 5 most and least infected countries in each continent?

2.	How has the recovery rate and the death rate changed across the 9 months for different countries and continents? Which countries have managed to control the spreading of Covid-19 better and which did not? Is this pattern any different in the 3-month internals?

3.	Is this pattern changing in different periods? (Dividing the 9 months into 3 intervals of 3-months each).
